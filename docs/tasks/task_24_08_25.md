Create an enquiry form with the following fields:
- Name
- Mobile
- Email
- Pass Out Year
- Technology

Requirements:
1. The form should be accessible via the route: "candidate/enquiry".
2. On submission, the enquiry data must be saved/stored.
3. Since we currently do not have a database established or backend available, all enquiry data should be persisted in localStorage.
4. Display all submitted enquiries in the admin panel, showing all the submitted fields.
5. Only admin users should have access to view the list of enquiries.
6. The UI for both the form and the list of submitted enquiries in the admin panel should follow our established list content pattern for consistency and clarity.
7. Additionally, implement filtering functionality on the enquiries list screen in the admin panel. Admin users should be able to filter the displayed enquiries based on submitted fields such as Technology and Pass Out Year.
